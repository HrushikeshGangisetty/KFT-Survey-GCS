## Pass 1 — W1-1: Repository and KMP skeleton (2026-09-24)

### What changed
- **Repo root:** `settings.gradle.kts` (module list), `build.gradle.kts` (plugin versions declared once), `gradle.properties`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes` (LF line endings everywhere, CRLF only for `.bat`), Gradle 9.7.1 wrapper.
- **`gradle/libs.versions.toml`:** every library version, checked against Maven Central / Google Maven on 2026-09-24 (Kotlin 2.4.20, Compose Multiplatform 1.12.1, AGP 9.4.1, mavlink-kotlin 1.2.15, Koin 4.2.2, maplibre-compose 0.17.0, …).
- **`gradle/gradle-daemon-jvm.properties`:** tells Gradle to run on JDK 25 and download it if missing.
- **`build-logic/`:** two convention plugins. `kft.kmp.library` sets up the Android + desktop targets and test libraries. `kft.kmp.compose` adds Compose on top.
- **Modules:** `core:geo`, `core:planning`, `core:mavlink`, `core:vehicle`, `core:terrain`, `core:geo-io`, `ui:map`, `feature:{connections,fly,plan,settings}`, `app:shared`, `app:android`, `app:desktop`. Most are empty for now. Their `build.gradle.kts` files already declare the allowed dependencies.
- **`core:geo`:** `LatLon` (validated WGS-84 position, with MAVLink ×1e7 conversion) and `Geodesy` (distance, bearing, destination point), with 7 tests.
- **`app:shared`:** `App()` root composable, dark theme, and `Platform` (`expect`/`actual`) showing which platform is running.
- **`app:android` / `app:desktop`:** thin shells that host `App()`.
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`:** Linux job (all tests + Android APK) and a Windows job (desktop tests + runnable distribution).
- **`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/spec/`, `docs/implementation/`, this log.**

### How it works
```
settings.gradle.kts ──includeBuild──▶ build-logic (compiles kft.kmp.library / kft.kmp.compose first)
        │
        └─include──▶ :core:* :ui:* :feature:*  each applies one convention plugin
                         │
                         ▼
                   :app:shared  (KMP: commonMain App(), androidMain/jvmMain actuals)
                     ▲       ▲
      :app:android ──┘       └── :app:desktop
      (Activity.setContent)      (Window { App() })
```
One `App()` composable is compiled twice: for Android (AAR inside the APK) and for the desktop JVM. Each shell only opens a window/activity and calls `App()`.

### Engineering learnings
- **Kotlin Multiplatform source sets.** `commonMain` is compiled for every target. `androidMain` and `jvmMain` (desktop) only for their own. *Why:* survey maths, MAVLink protocols and ViewModels are written once. Only true platform edges (serial ports, file paths, Bluetooth) are written twice.
- **`expect`/`actual`** (`Platform.kt`). `commonMain` declares what it needs, and each platform supplies it. The compiler refuses to build if a target is missing its `actual`. *Why over an interface + DI:* for a tiny, static fact like the platform name, `expect`/`actual` is simpler. For things with state or lifecycle (transports), we'll use interfaces injected by Koin instead, because those can be faked in tests.
- **Convention plugins (`build-logic`).** Thirteen modules each need the same target setup. Copy-pasting it would drift. *Why an included build over `buildSrc`:* a change in an included build only recompiles the plugins, and it's the pattern Gradle and Google recommend today.
- **Version catalog.** One file owns every version, and modules refer to `libs.xxx`. *Why:* a version bump is one reviewable line, and Claude Code can't quietly introduce a second version of a library.
- **AGP 9 + KMP.** In AGP 9 an Android *application* module can't also be a KMP module. That's why the shared UI lives in `app:shared` (a KMP library using `com.android.kotlin.multiplatform.library`) and `app:android` is a thin application. It also forced **`compileSdk = 37`**, because Compose 1.12's AndroidX artifacts require it.
- **`core:geo` was split out of `core:planning`.** `LatLon` is needed by the map, vehicle and terrain modules. If it lived in `planning`, the map would depend on survey maths. A tiny pure module for shared value types keeps the dependency graph honest.
- **Validation in constructors** (`LatLon.init`). An impossible coordinate fails where it's created, not three layers later inside a mission upload.
- **mavlink-kotlin on Android.** Its artifacts publish `jvm` variants but no `android` variant. The Kotlin Gradle plugin lets an Android target consume a `jvm` variant, and the Android build resolved them successfully. This is the first proof that our MAVLink choice works in both apps.

### What to look at
1. `build-logic/src/main/kotlin/kft.kmp.library.gradle.kts:11-24`: the two targets every module gets, and why Android host tests are on.
2. `app/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/kft/gcs/app/Platform.kt:9` with its two `actual`s in `androidMain` / `jvmMain`: `expect`/`actual` in its simplest form.
3. `core/geo/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/kft/gcs/core/geo/Geodesy.kt:22` and `GeodesyTest`: the testing pattern every maths function will follow (analytic reference values, round-trip checks).

### Tests
- `GeodesyTest` (7 tests, run twice: desktop JVM + Android host). Checks: 1° of latitude ≈ 111,195 m; equator→pole = πR/2 exactly; shortest path across the antimeridian; bearing east = 90°; destination/distance/bearing round-trip at 4 bearings from the SITL home; lossless ×1e7 conversion; invalid latitude rejected.
- `PlatformTest`: the `actual` name is non-blank on both platforms.
- Build checks: `./gradlew check :app:android:assembleDebug` passes. The desktop app was launched and showed "KFT GCS … Running on Linux · JVM 25".
- **Manual check for you:** `gradlew.bat :app:desktop:run` on Windows should open a dark window that says "Running on Windows 11 · JVM 25…". `gradlew.bat :app:android:installDebug` with the emulator running should show the same screen with "Android …".

### Open questions / next
- Next task: **W1-2, the map spike** (`docs/implementation/00-maps-decision.md` §4, checks M1–M8), then the Connections screen as the MVVM worked example.
- Package root is `com.kft.gcs` (assumed; `in.pavaman…` would need backticks because `in` is a Kotlin keyword).
- `targetSdk` stays at 36 while `compileSdk` is 37. We'll raise targetSdk in its own pass after checking the Android 17 behaviour changes.
